Hello! I am an undergraduate student at the University of Texas at Austin Computer Science advised by Prof. <a href="https://eunsol.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Eunsol Choi</a>. 

My research focuses on the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Human-Computer Interaction. I am interested in the interaction between the user and the large language models. My goal is to build reliable LLMs through the growth in the inclusiveness and developing tools for increasing factuality and stability of the models. 

I have previously worked as a Software Quality Assurance Engineer intern at SparkCognition and VPlusLab.
