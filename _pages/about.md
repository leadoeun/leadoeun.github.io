Hello! I am a CSE masters student at The Ohio State University advised by <a href="http://shocheen.com" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Sachin Kumar </a>. I completed my undergraduate at University of Texas at Austin Computer Science advised by <a href="https://eunsol.github.io/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Prof. Eunsol Choi</a>. 

My research primiarily focuses on Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I am particularly interested in evaluation and adaptation of language model across different tasks and domains. 

I have previously worked as a Software Quality Assurance Engineer intern at <a href="https://avathon.com/">Avathon (previously SparkCognition)</a> and VPlusLab.
